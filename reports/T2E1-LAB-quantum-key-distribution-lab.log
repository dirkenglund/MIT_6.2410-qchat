 Laboratory goals


1. Obtain raw key of length > 
2. Obtain sifted key
2.1) what is the fraction of sifted key? ..

3. Error Correction
2.1) what's the erorr rate before and after error correction? [how does this depend on the key size N_K?]
2.2) What's the highest efficiency of your erorr code that you can achieve for final error rate < 10^-10
2.3) 
4. Privacy amplification
4.1) what's the higheest efficiency you can achieve for privacy amplification?
4.2) what's the overall efficiency you were able to achieve from the distilled key? 

* iterate hardware and algorithms to improve efficiencies 

* [how much can passive Eve get?]


*'what are assumptions on Eve .. cycle through'

finite key effects.. e
