    "Many quantum engineering applications leverage the unique properties of quantum light and its interactions with basic optical elements.  For example, many applications will have multiple stages for splitting, propagating, and recombining/interfering photons before final detection.  For instance, a simplified optical implementation of quantum key distribution is shown in the figure below.\n",

    "In this chapter and the next we will discuss interference phenomena in two parts.  In part 1 (this chapter), we examine entangled photon pair interference by way of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect.  We will discuss how photons interact with beamsplitters, how to treat their interference, and signal processing methods such as coincidence detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In part 2 (the following chapter) we will explore the concept of homodyne detection where we leverage the interference between more general quantum states and coherent states to characterize quantum fields.  Building on this we will study how homodyne detection with squeezed light can be used to performe distance measurements with extremely high sensitivity.  Such techniques were in large part perfected for the detection of gravitational waves, but can be applied more generally for engineering applications at smaller scales."

For these cases the states are either perfectly indistinguishible or distinguishable.  A more complete model would actually have to expand each input into the frequency domain and model the interference between each spectral component individually.  However this approach is much more involved.  In the end, both approaches result in the same predictions as discussed above.  \n",
