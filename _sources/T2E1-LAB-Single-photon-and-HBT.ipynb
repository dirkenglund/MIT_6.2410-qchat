    " * specs on the 50/50 beam splitter (loss, is it 50/50?)\n",

    "What is the expected g2 of a heralded single photon source?\n",

    "What g2 do you expect to see?\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you set-up the experiment with the tools you have?\n",

    "#### Procedure\n",
    "Set up the HBT experiment. Record your measurements for singles, 2 fold coindcidences, and 3 fold coincidences. Calculate g2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the measurement until you converge on a mean and variance for your g2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat at different pump currents: 10 mA, 25 mA, 40 mA. How does g2 differ? Why do think that happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when you change your integration time from 0.1 seconds to 1 second to 20 seconds? Which one do you think provides the most accurate g2? Why?\n",
