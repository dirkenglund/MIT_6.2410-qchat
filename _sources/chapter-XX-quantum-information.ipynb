    "For instance, suppose we wanted to represent the state of $N$ two-level particles, such as the polarization states of photons or the orientation of electron spins. This would us to store $2^N$ complex numbers, i.e., $2^{N+1}$ real numbers. Suppose each real number were stored in a 32-bit classical register. Then we'd need $32\\times2^{N+1}$ bits. If $N=50$, that's already 4500 tera-bytes, and if $N=500$, we would require more bits than there are atoms in the universe (double-check!).  In a quantum computer, a register of 500 qubits would suffice! Thus, we already see that for certain applications -- like trying to simulate a quantum system -- the quantum memory is exponentially more powerful than a classical memory. The idea of using a quantum system for simulating a classical system was proposed by Richard Feynman in the early eighties, and is called quantum simulation. \n",
