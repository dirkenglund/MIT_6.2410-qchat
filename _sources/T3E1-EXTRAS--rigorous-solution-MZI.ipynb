    "In the course material for the discussion of single-photon interference and the interaction-free measurement, we took a shortcut to calculating the photon number expectation by ignoring the operators of the vacuum state inputs.  This simplifies the problem, but is not a rigorous solution.  A particular shortcoming is that this approach would give incorrect results for calculating the noise properties of the photon number at the detectors as in that case the vacuum state input does matter."
