This will require us to develop a proficiency in understanding how quantum signals are generated, transmitted, and received.  It will also require us to understand the limitations of measurements, and how to account for noise.\n",

This chapter overviews basic concepts in quantum optics that will be drawn on throughout the course.  It should be used as both review and reference material.  For those interested in going deeper than the surface level overview we present here, references are provided at various points."

Then, you mark the region whos center is the mean value of $A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ of the state, with a width of $2\\Delta A^{(\\theta)}$ for each value of $\\theta$.
