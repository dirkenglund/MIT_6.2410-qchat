    "In this course we will focus our attention on how to engineer quantum systems to securely transmit information, perform sensitive measurements, and compute among other things.  This will require us to develop a proficiency in understanding how quantum signals are generated, transmitted, and received.  It will also require us to understand the limitations of measurements, and how to account for noise.\n",

    "While we will introduce several quantum engineering platforms in this course, a large number of concepts will be taught through the lens of quantum optics.  This chapter overviews basic concepts in quantum optics that will be drawn on throughout the course.  It should be used as both review and reference material.  For those interested in going deeper than the surface level overview we present here, references are provided at various points."
